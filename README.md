Object-Oriented Programming Assignment – Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

Description

This project demonstrates key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
It is divided into two main activities:

Design Your Own Class – Creating custom classes with attributes, methods, constructors, and inheritance.

Polymorphism Challenge – Implementing multiple classes that share the same method (move()), but behave differently.

The goal of this project is to practice:

Encapsulation (hiding details)

Inheritance (reusing and extending classes)

Polymorphism (same method, different behavior)

Abstraction (generalization of actions)

How to Run

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

Save the code files (e.g., activity1.py and activity2.py).

Run the files in your terminal or IDE:

python activity1.py
python activity2.py

Expected Output
Activity 1 (Superhero Example)
I am Flash, and my power is Super Speed!
Superman is flying at 900 km/h!

Activity 2 (Vehicles Example)
Driving 🚗
Flying ✈️
Sailing 🚤
